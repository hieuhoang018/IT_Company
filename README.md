# IT_Company

This C++ is my final project for the course Programming 2: Structures

The program acts as a virtual IT company where the user can store staff and projects' information, projects taken by the employees and provide the user with the data stored within the program. Each time the program expects an input, it prints "IT>" and the user can type in the wanted command to their needs. The command can be upper-case, lower-case or mixed letter. 

The program will also prints error messages to any error along the process of using the programs.

The program can be run using QtCreator
